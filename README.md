# AI-Assistant

An intelligent, voice-enabled assistant built in Python—designed to perform speech-based tasks using NLP techniques and modular utilities.

## Features
- Voice interaction: recognize and respond through speech (text-to-speech and speech recognition).
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) for understanding and executing user commands.
- Highly modular structure (e.g., `NLP`, `speech`, and `Utils`) for easy expansion and maintenance.

## Repository Structure
├── main.py             # Entry point to launch the assistant
├── README.md           # This documentation
├── NLP/                # NLP modules: intent recognition, text processing, etc.
├── speech/             # Speech I/O: recognition and synthesis logic
├── Utils/              # Utilities: logging, configuration, helpers
├── .env                # Environment variables (e.g., API keys, tokens)
└── requirements.txt    # Dependencies (to be added)

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   1. git clone https://github.com/Nehal-31/AI-Assistant.git
   cd AI-Assistant

2.	Set up environment:
   
	•	Create a Python virtual environment:
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate

 	•	Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

 	•	Populate .env file with required credentials (e.g., speech APIs, keys).
3. Run the assistant: python main.py

4.	Begin interacting with your AI Assistant through voice or command-line, as configured.

How It Works
	•	Speech Input: Listens via microphone, processes via speech recognition in speech/.
	•	NLP Processing: Interprets commands in NLP/ and determines actions.
	•	Utilities: Shared modules (in Utils/) are used for logging, configuration, or helper functions.
	•	Response: Replies are synthesized back to speech or printed out.
